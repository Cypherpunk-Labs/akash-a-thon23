# 2. Confidential Containers.

## As a web admin I want to ensure I can protect any data I may collect in accordance with the law.

### Tasks

- [x] FAILED > https://github.com/confidential-containers
  - [x] FAILED >operator install failing (intel SGX)
- [x] test local dev hardware for TPM, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/341629/how-to-determine-if-computer-has-tpm-trusted-platform-module-available
- [x] Research Kata-containers ::Gist: k3s handles containerd so need to patch config to make work.
- [x] First POC
  - [x] install operator https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/3.1.3/tools/packaging/kata-deploy/README.md
  - [x] mutate deployment byhand
  - [x] automate mutation (watch for custom ENV-VARS) [Custom Operator Controller](https://github.com/Cypherpunk-Labs/akash-confidential-containers-operator).
  - [ ] stretch goal extend SDL
- [ ] Demo Vuln
  - [x] SUCCESS > sudo sysdig -c spy_users (Host no longer has visibility into cmd executed such as decryption etc, uname -r show different kernel)
  - [*] Debug Exec Volatility3 Dump Ram (FAILED > Spawned in own process)
  - [ ] Exec into Shell, provider can still do this action but if tools to debug or poke around are removed it should be challenging to steal credentials now that we have shown the debug exec to fail attaching correctly.
  - [ ] Filesystem, don't let secrets touch disk. PATH: /run/k3s/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/k8s.io
- All above need addons installed onto provider k8s, That AkashOS maybe good project to feed in some golden package requirements (Else we can only obfuscate inside process which is a lost game!)
