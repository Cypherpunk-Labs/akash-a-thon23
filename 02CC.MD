# 2. Confidential Containers.

- [Demo Video](https://ody.sh/zQKz7A8sNi)
- [Source Code for Custom Operator Controller](https://github.com/Cypherpunk-Labs/akash-confidential-containers-operator).

# User Stories

## As a web admin I want to ensure I can protect my secrets from unauthorized parties.

# Outcome

- Working code base with clear documentation and test cases > 40%, pipeline to build and publish the operator package.

# Workstream

### Tasks

- [ ] Research how to attest code is inside coco/kata-container before fetching secret. apt install -y virt-what. normal pod will return nill whereas kata-* will return kvm.
  - '# apt install -y tpm-tools && tpm_version' normal pod and kata pod both return 'Tspi_Context_Connect failed: 0x00003011 - layer=tsp, code=0011 (17), Communication failure'
  - '# dmesg | grep -i tpm | grep -i Reserving' normal pod return 'dmesg: read kernel buffer failed: Operation not permitted' and kata pod returns nil.
- [x] FAILED > https://github.com/confidential-containers
  - [ ] [Issue Logged](https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/issues/258)
      - [X] Setup full k8s cluster (See Demo Folder for Ansible Kubeadm setup), retest coco. Maybe Supported [ microk8s minikube ]. Not supported [ k3s rke2 k0s ]
      - [X] Failed > retest Coco in GCP VM.
      - [ ] rebuild baremetal I7(7thGen) from k3s to kubeadm.
      - [ ] retest Coco on baremetal I7(7thGen).
  - [x] FAILED >operator install failing (intel SGX)
- [x] test local dev hardware for TPM, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/341629/how-to-determine-if-computer-has-tpm-trusted-platform-module-available
- [x] Research Kata-containers ::Gist: k3s handles containerd so need to patch config to make work.
- [x] First POC
  - [x] install operator https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/3.1.3/tools/packaging/kata-deploy/README.md
  - [x] mutate deployment byhand
  - [x] automate mutation (watch for custom ENV-VARS) [Custom Operator Controller](https://github.com/Cypherpunk-Labs/akash-confidential-containers-operator).
    - [ ] Dependency check - Install requirements.
  - [ ] Open Proposal: stretch goal extend SDL (Getting Annotations supported maybe a better proposal for offchain expansions and preview features)
- [ ] Demo Vuln
  - [x] SUCCESS > sudo sysdig -c spy_users (Host no longer has visibility into cmd executed such as decryption etc, uname -r show different kernel)
  - [*] Debug Exec Volatility3 Dump Ram (FAILED > Spawned in own process)
  - [ ] Exec into Shell, provider can still do this action but if tools to debug or poke around are removed it should be challenging to steal credentials now that we have shown the debug exec to fail attaching correctly.
  - [ ] Filesystem, don't let secrets touch disk. PATH: /run/k3s/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/k8s.io
  - [x] Add unit test
  - [x] update readme
  - [x] record demo video
