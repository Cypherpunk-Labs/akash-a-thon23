# 3. Cluster Autoscaler

## Background

Given that energy costs are soaring, as a provider this can be a big input cost to your business model, and if you have underutilised capacity you are literally burning your money. So this Idea was really about minimising those costs to ensure a more profitable business model by powering down spare capacity to ensure the powered on servers have better utilisation and that we can dynamically scale our capacity within our physical means.

# User stories

## As a Provider I want to minimise my energy costs by scaling down excess capacity, and power back up as demand increases.

# Outcome

- High level design (quick sketch)
- Dropped: ---Working code base with clear documentation and test cases > 80%, pipeline to build and publish the operator package.---

# Workstream

### Tasks

- [x] Define the parameters for our custom machine set resource.
- [x] Create design diagram 
- [ ] Research Steps needed to safely shutdown idle nodes.
- [x] Research Steps to power up nodes (IPMI based).
- [ ] Research Tools to scale up/down load for demo's.
- [ ] Is 'Cluster Downscaler' more accurate term, since the intent is to reduce power usage and save cost if load dictates.
