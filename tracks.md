Deployment and Orchestration - Unstoppable Shade dApp deployment (stkd-SCRT)
This hackathon track emphasizes using Akash deployment and orchestration capabilities to deploy an ‚Äúunstoppable‚Äù decentralized interface for the suite of private-by-default dApps that comprise Shade Protocol. This hackathon track focused on the deployment of a decentralized UI for stkd-SCRT contracts using Akash.

üèÜ BOUNTY PRIZE AMOUNT

Total prizes of $1500 USD in SHD
ABOUT SECRET NETWORK

Secret Network offers scalable permissionless smart contracts with a private by default design‚Äî  Secret Contracts are an implementation of the Rust-based smart contract compiling toolkit CosmWasm, adding private metadata possibilities.

ABOUT SHADE PROTOCOL

Shade Protocol is an interconnected suite of private by default DeFi primitives that provides a unified user experience for DeFi participants that includes, but is not limited to private liquid staking derivatives, private overcollateralized stablecoin, front-running resistant hybrid AMM, and bonds.

Our full docs are available at: https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/

ABOUT Liquid Staked SCRT (stkd-SCRT)

Staked SCRT (stkd-SCRT) is a liquid staking derivative built by Shade Protocol enabling users to secure Secret Network and other application protocols without exposing their privacy, all while earning staking rewards. stkd-SCRT represents staked SCRT on Secret Network, combining the cumulative value of deposited SCRT collateral with compounded staking rewards via the staking derivative contract. stkd-SCRT tokens are minted via deposits of SCRT. stkd-SCRT is a completely on-chain dApp.

ABOUT ARCHWAY

Archway is a Cosmos-native permissionless incentivized smart contract chain that is optimized for a seamless developer experience that allows for easy deployment of high-performance dapps that capture the value they create for the network. As developers build and launch impactful dapps, they receive a proportional share of network fees, inflation, and smart contract premiums. This model enables dapps to access recurring value generation and participate in the upside of the underlying protocol as they are able to directly capture the value they bring to the network . For Archway, it tightly aligns the incentives of developers and their dapp communities with the overall ecosystem.
